# Tetris++

Author: Luciana Toledo-Lopez


I would like to make a tetris app as my project. 
Tetris is one of my favorite games, and I am familiar with the basic necessities of a tetris game, 
as well as possible ways to extend it. I am planning on making a basically tetris game with blocks that fall down, 
and if there is a row of blocks, I will eliminate them. Scoring will be based on the original BPS system,
 and after a certain amount of lines cleared the level and speed of the falling block will increase.

I will use the pretzel gui library in order to implement my game gui and create a slider for the brightness of my game.
Since the snake project is also a game involving rectangle blocks, I will use the snake project as a resource to research 
and structure my project. I will also use 
[this](http://javilop.com/gamedev/tetris-tutorial-in-c-platform-independent-focused-in-game-logic-for-beginners/)
 tetris tutorial to help guide me.

I plan on spending week one setting up the game and mapping out how I will specifically implement each part. I will decide on which classes should be made to represent the tetris pieces and utilize my pretzel library. week two and three I plan on writing the game logic as well as implementing the gui. If i have extra time, some of my stretch goale would be to create a start page, add an "up next" piece image and create a scoreboard.
